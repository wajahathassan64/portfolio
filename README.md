### Contributions
- At SadaPay, I built key features such as the Card Ordering process, designed and developed the Transaction History, and transformed simple Transaction Details into dynamic ones. This enhancement not only helped the Card Squad but also made life easier for other squads using the Transaction Details feature. The Card Ordering feature has generated significant revenue for SadaPay. Additionally, I customized and optimized the main application dashboard to display Card tiles and Transaction details, along with other widgets.
- Built a high-quality product with 97% code coverage via unit testing and 100% feature coverage through UI testing, with extreme programming practices such as TDD, Trunk-Based Development, Ping Pong Programming.
- Created a micro frontend app for testing the feature module, which reduced the feature testing time by 35%.
- Automated iOS app CI/CD workflows with GitHub Actions and Bitrise, improving feature delivery time by 20%.
- Introduced a common module with Kotlin Multiplatform for analytics events, reducing discrepancies between iOS and Android by 95%.
- Implemented MVVM modular architecture for an iOS project, reducing release friction, enabling independent squad work, and ensuring pipeline stability.
- Implemented UI test structure using SBUITestTunnel, reducing QA dependency by 90% and accelerating the application delivery process by 75%.
- Collaborated with the team to customize the OpenAPI generator, streamlining API contracts across platforms and eliminating 100% discrepancies across all platforms, which significantly improved product quality.
